<h1>First IOS app i have made</h1>
<hr/>
<h4>Basic Login and SignUp screens with cool animations allow the app to have security as well as a simple home page with a logout function</h4>
<p>Although I planned on making this using realm I decided to make the Auth with firebase. I may in the future use the realm database along with the firebase auth to make a full application, I just don't know what I want to with it yet.<p>
